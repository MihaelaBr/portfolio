# Portfolio Michaela Brankova

This is the repository for my data professional portfolio webpage. Here you will find all my recent data projects on different topics.
I decided to use GitHub Pages to host my page as it looked as the best solution so I chose a Jekyll Theme as a Template to start building my Portfolio Page.
It turned into a full project as I felt the need to change the code to display the results of my work in the best way possible.
My HTML, JavaScript, Git and SCSS skills got a quick improvement during the development of this webpage and I plan to keep improving them.

# About me
I seek to uncover the secrets of the data I work with and sometimes engineer itâ€™s path and transformation to the vizualisation tools I use. My background is in 
managing technical projects and working with geospatial data and maps. Excited about anything related to Data and Web Analytics, Data Engineering and Data Science (ML and GenAI), 
Process automations and App development.

In this Portfolio you can see a few of my data and vizualisation projects created around business topics, some that have a special focus on the urban and natural environment, 
and also a few that include personal interests like music and movies.

My strenghts are SQL, Cloud DWH, Dashboards and Visualisations in most of the Business Intelligence and Geo Information Systems tools. I enjoy very much working on improving my 
Python and R programming, ETL/ELT pipeline building skills as well.

Forty - Jekyll Theme

A Jekyll version of the "Forty" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).  

Original README from HTML5 UP:

This is Forty, my latest and greatest addition to HTML5 UP and, per its incredibly
creative name, my 40th (woohoo)! It's built around a grid of "image tiles" that are
set up to smoothly transition to secondary landing pages (for which a separate page
template is provided), and includes a number of neat effects (check out the menu!),
extra features, and all the usual stuff you'd expect. Hope you dig it!
