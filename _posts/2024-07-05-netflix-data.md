This was a small personal project inspired while exploring the vast dataset offerings in Kaggle. I found this pre-cleaned detailed dataset for Netflix movies and series for the years between 1980 and 2021 and I was excited to see what recommendations I could get by answering the following questions:

1. Which movies and series are in the top 5 rated for each decade with genre information?
2. Which movies and series are number 1 for each year with genre information?
3. Who are the actors starring these movies in series?
4. Everything has to be presented as interactive charts in one dashboard.

As a cinephile who watches many movies and tv series I was interested in learning what is good on Netflix and what is not so interesting based on IMDB scoring in different genres and organized by years. I also did an analysis on the famous actors represented in the top movies and series in the dataset.
