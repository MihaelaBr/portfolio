I seek to uncover the secrets of the data I work with and sometimes engineer 
it's path and transformation to the vizualisation tools I use. My background is in managing technical 
projects and working with geospatial data and maps. Excited about anything related to Data 
and Web Analytics, Data Engineering and Data Science (ML and GenAI), Process automations and App development.

In this Portfolio you can see a few of my data and vizualisation projects created around business 
topics, some that have a special focus on the urban and natural environment, and a few that 
include personal interests like music, art and movies.

My strenghts are SQL, Cloud DWH, Dashboards and Visualisations in most of the Business Intelligence
and Geo Information Systems tools. I enjoy very much working on improving my Python and R programming, 
ETL/ELT pipeline building skills as well.
