I developed two separate no-code apps leveraging Google Appsheet, AppsScript and Sheets. The apps aimed at increasing the work efficiency and internal process compliance through process automation of two teams: Recruiting and Operations. 
#### Jobs app - Recruiting team

**Challenge**
The recruiting process was not streamlined and the team and managers was struggling keeping track of active jobs with a great amount of candidates. 

**Solution**
Collects all jobs and candidate data in one place while ensuring limited access (role-based) to the app and GDPR compliance. Hiring managers and Recruiters as well as HR have access to different parts of the app as each is responsible for different steps of the hiring process. Some parts are also automated, for example after an interview is scheduled by the recruiter the confirmation is sent to the hiring manager's email by the app.

**Outcome**
Automated 30% of the manually performed steps and streamlined recruiting process in a single interface.

#### Requests app - Operations team

**Challenge**
The operations team was overwhelmed by the amount of requests they needed to handle and track for travel, hardware and procurement. They also needed a simple way to track inventory and accurately and quickly inform employees of the stage of their request.

**Solution**
Collects all internal requests for Hardware, Software, Travel and Procurement while ensuring limited access to the app and GDPR compliance. The Operations team have access to and handle all incoming requests, part of the process is automated through Bots. For example Request Status Changes, Email notifications for updates of requests, etc. are automated.

**Outcome**
Automated 50% of the manually performed steps and streamlined requests process in a single interface.

The applications were developed using Agile methodology, which involved iterative two-week sprints where I prioritized tasks based on their business value and the respective teams' feedback as main apps users.
