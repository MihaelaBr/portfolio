			<h2>Brief Overview</h2>
		</header>
		<p>This was a small personal project inspired while exploring the vast dataset offerings in Kaggle. I found this pre-cleaned detailed dataset for Netflix movies and series for the years between 1980 and 2021 and I was excited to see what recommendations I could get by answering the following questions:

- Which movies and series are in the top 5 rated for each decade with genre information?
- Which movies and series are number 1 for each year with genre information?
- Who are the actors starring these movies in series?
- Everything has to be presented as interactive charts in one dashboard.</p>

					<h3>Data and process</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As a cinephile who watches many movies and tv series (probably more than I should) I was interested in learning what is good to watch on Netflix and what is not so interesting based on IMDB scoring in different genres and organized by years. I also did an analysis on the famous actors represented in the top movies and series in the dataset.</p>
