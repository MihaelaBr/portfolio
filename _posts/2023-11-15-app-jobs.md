This No-code app development project was created leveraging Google Appsheet and Google Sheets for a Cloud Services provider company that I work for. 

It aimed at improving the work of the recruiting team by collecting all jobs and candidate data in one place while ensuring limited access to the app and GDPR compliance. 

The project was developed using Agile methodology, which involved iterative two-week sprints where the cross-functional team prioritized tasks based on their business value and the HR/Recruiting team's feedback who are the main app user.
