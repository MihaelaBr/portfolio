					<h3>The data</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Data was provided by Spotify after an official request in April 2024. All initial files provided by Spotify came in JSON format, so in order to have a clearer idea of what is inside the data 1 main file with my account's music streaming history was converted to XSLX format. It was then quickly assessed and cleaned inside Google Sheets. After that the file's data was loaded in a Jupyter Notebook where it went through several ... using pandas, seaborn and ... Python Libraries.</p>
