					<h3>Data and process</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Data was provided by Spotify after an official request in April 2024. All initial files provided by Spotify came in JSON format, so in order to have a clearer idea of what is inside the data 1 main file with my account's music streaming history was converted to XSLX format. It was then quickly assessed and cleaned inside Google Sheets. After that the file's data was loaded in a Jupyter Notebook where it went through several ... using pandas, seaborn and ... Python Libraries. The same data was used to make a dashboard for this project in Tableau Public.</p>

				<p>The clean Jupyter Notebook with visualisations in it as well as additional information and the used data without PII was added to a github repository (link below). The created in Tableau Public Dashboard can be accessed through the second link below. </p>

					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The project was inspired by a Women in Data Science (WiDS) Workshop on using Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualisations for Spotify data. I used the initial Jupyter Notebook from the link as a template to work with my own data but built ontop of it in terms of visualisations features, metrics used and general analysis. </p>
