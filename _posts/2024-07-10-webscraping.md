This Web Scraping and Visualisations project was created using Python and Beautiful Soup and later in Tableau using the data for museums from the official Zuerich.com page, where all tourist information for the city can be found. 

The project was inspired by a dashboard found in Tableau Public where All Berlin Restaurant were mapped based on web scraping data.
