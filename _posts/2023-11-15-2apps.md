I developed two separate no-code apps leveraging Google Appsheet, AppsScript and Sheets for a client company. The apps aimed at increasing the work efficiency and internal process compliance through process automation of two teams: Recruiting and Operations. 
#### Jobs app - Recruiting team
Collects all jobs and candidate data in one place while ensuring limited access to the app and GDPR compliance. Hiring managers and Recruiters as well as HR have access to different parts of the app as each is responsible for different steps of the hiring process. Some parts are also automated, for example after an interview is scheduled by the recruiter the confirmation is sent to the hiring manager's email by the app.

#### Requests app - Operations team
Collects all internal requests for Hardware, Software, Travel and Procurement while ensuring limited access to the app and GDPR compliance. The Operations team have access to and handle all incoming requests, part of the process is automated through Bots. For example Request Status Changes, Email notifications for updates of requests, etc. are automated.

The applications were developed using Agile methodology, which involved iterative two-week sprints where I prioritized tasks based on their business value and the respective teams' feedback as main apps users.
