This Sales Pipeline Dashboards project was prepared for a client. The C-level executives and the manager of the Company' Sales team needed Dashboards to track the leads currently in the pipeline along with hystorical data with conversion rates. All company data and any PII is edited out.

Data is initially collected in Jira from the Sales Representatives. It is ingested into Google BigQuery using an app from the Jira Marketplace called "BigQuery Connector for Jira", where it is prepared and transformed using SQL and then connected with Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) to create the visualisations and multiple dashboard pages for Active and Closed leads, Weekly reporting by Sales and Technical Representatives.

The pages from the dashboard are used by management and C-level executives to evaluate the current leads and this part of the work of the Sales Representatives.
