This is a Sales Pipeline Dashboards project for a Cloud Services company called Cloud Office, where I work at. All PII is edited out. 

Data is initially collected in Jira from the Sales Representatives. It is ingested in Google BigQuery using Jira API solution, where it is prepared and transformed using SQL and then connected with Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) to create the visualisations and multiple dashboard pages. 

The pages from the dashboard are used by management and C-level executives to evaluate the current leads and this part of the work of the Sales Representatives.
